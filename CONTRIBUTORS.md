# CONTRIBUTORS

The SoundRise 2.0 application is an implementation of Serena Zanolla's proposal [^1] done by Giada Zuccolo [^2][^3].
Zuccolo's implementation uses vocal tract (formant-based) analysis to detect vowels.
This version includes contributions from Francesco Frigato [^4] combining a Feed-Forward Neural Networking with LPCC+MFCC feature extraction.
This version has been restructured and integrated by Andrea Franceschini.
